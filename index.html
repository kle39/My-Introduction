  <h2>Taking it back a bit, I was born in Pittsburgh where I still reside today. I live here with my family - my mom, my dad, and my sister. I am definitely a family-oriented person and I have a large extended family on both of my parent's sides with such close relationships that I cherish. My family members and friends are all considered "family" to me. They are people I truly cannot imagine my life without. They are all encouraging, supportive, and loving, and a big part of who I am comes from them.</h2>

         <h1>Why UX Design and Usability Testing? Where do you see yourself within this nexus of UX design and product development? </h1>
  <h2>Up until recently, I was not quite sure which specific path I wanted to be on within Information Science. However, being able to have the opportunity at Pitt to explore a wide variety of courses has allowed me to find the path I am definitely interested in taking and learning more about, which is UX/UI. This semester I have centered my courses around UX/UI, and I am enjoying them all. I feel myself being pulled in this direction because I enjoy both designing and helping other people, and that definitely comes alive in UX/UI. Outside of the classroom I enjoy spending time pursuing my passions. One of my most favorite passions is dancing and teaching. I have been dancing since age 3, and I now also teach my own dance classes to younger children. Dancing/dance teaching is a huge part of who I am, and I cannot imagine my life without it. Another passion I find joy in pursuing is volunteering. In the fall semester, I volunteered with a few other Pitt students to help the senior citizens of Macedonia FACE understand technology and I am looking forward to pursuing this opportunity again this semester! A few other interests I hold include shopping and building puzzles!</h2>

<!--Let's talk a little about the future. After school what kind of job or career would you like to pursue? What is your reasoning for going on this path? How might it connect to all of these prior elements--field of study, home and family, interests and activities? Why is this job or career important to you? Why is it important generally?-->
    
<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">   
         <h1>Where do you want your knowledge and skills to take you?</h1>
  <h2>After I graduate this summer, I am hoping to pursue a career in either UX or UI. I can see myself in UX/UI for a few reasons. I enjoy the creative side that UI has to offer. At the same time, I also very much enjoy the sense of empathy and considering human factors that UX has to offer. Either way, I am open to whichever path I end up on! When I think more about UX/UI I find myself relating it to my own life. I can relate this specifically to both dance/dance teaching and volunteering. I enjoy the movement of dance in addition to creating choreography and editing music for my students. For volunteering, I enjoy creating the slideshows/handouts for the seniors. In both respects, I enjoy creating not only for myself, but for other people. UX/UI connects the elements of Information Science, my home and family, along with my interests and activities. I find happiness in creating something others can benefit from and enjoy. That is why I find myself being passionate about UX/UI and fitting into this area somehow, someway.</h2>
